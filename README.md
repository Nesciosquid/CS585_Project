# Project: Browser-based 3D Pose Estimation

[Background information for our project is available here.](http://www.heuckroth.com/CS585_Project/proposal/)

## Tools Used

   [js-aruco](https://github.com/jcmellado/js-aruco): Augmented reality library which provided both marker detection and basic 3D pose estimation functions
   [kalman.js](https://github.com/itamarwe/kalman): Kalman Filter library, used to smooth out position and rotation data between samples
   [sylvester.js](http://sylvester.jcoglan.com/): Matrix math library, required to support kalman.js 
   [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/): 3D graphics library, which provides support rendering 3D objects using WebGL
   [STL Viewer](https://gist.github.com/bellbind/477817982584ac8473ef/): Used for loading arbitrary STL files.
   [BadTV Shader](https://www.airtightinteractive.com/demos/js/badtvshader/): Used to provide hologram-like distortion effects to the rendered image.
   [webcam.js](https://github.com/jhuckaby/webcamjs): Provides cross-browser support for loading webcam images as standard HTML5 video.
   [Google Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io/): Web framework for look and feel.
